## Introduction

Every wanted to try arm wrestling, but you have weak arms?
Are you a pro gamer who knows how to mash a button?
Gamers and weaklings rejoice, because we have a solution for you! Using our uniquely crafted Arduino setup, we can use a
Servo motor to simulate an arm wrestling match. All you have to do is mash the buttons!
Be careful though! There is a third player who controls an LED. If the player isn't lighting the LED, you will give
a buff to the other player! Who can win in this game of wits? Play our game and find out!

- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.
