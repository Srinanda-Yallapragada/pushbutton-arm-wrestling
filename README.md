## Introduction

Every wanted to try arm wrestling, but you have weak arms?
Are you a pro gamer who knows how to mash a button?
Gamers and weaklings rejoice, because we have a solution for you! Using our uniquely crafted Arduino setup, we can use a
Servo motor to simulate an arm wrestling match. All you have to do is mash the buttons!
Be careful though! There is a third player who controls an LED. If the player isn't lighting the LED, you will give
a buff to the other player! Who can win in this game of wits? Play our game and find out!
